# Popular Movies, Stage 1
My submission for the first project in the Google/Udacity "Associate Android Developer Fast Track" course.

## Notes
To run this app, you will need to replace "your API key here" in the following section of AndroidManifest.xml --
```
        <meta-data
                android:name="TMDB_API_KEY"
                android:value="your API key here"/>
```
-- with your own TMDb API key.
